Extracting text from an image:
It involves using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to recognize and convert the text present in the image into a machine-readable format.
EasyOCR is a deep learning-based OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine that is capable of extracting text from images. EasyOCR uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for character recognition, and it also employs a language model to improve recognition accuracy.
